description: 'Caperdonich’s conception dates back much further to 1898.  Mothballed for approximately six decades Caperdonich’s production was reinstated in 1965 to fulfil demand for Glen Grant, culminating in the expansion of the Caperdonich distillery site in 1967. The new pot stills were steam heated which was a very modern technology at the time and the whisky was given a new appellation in 1966, Caperdonich. The name was chosen after its water source. '

article1title: 'FROM THE CASK'
article1para1: 'A distillery that was one of Speyside’s best kept secrets hidden away from the public eye in the village of Rothes. Built to support its more famous neighbour at Glen Grant, Caperdonich went on to produce its own unique spirit.'
article1para2: 'Built in 1898, the distillery spent most of its existence closed, finally ending its days in 2002 and being razed to the ground in 2011. Caperdonich lives on in the exceptionally rare bottlings, a distillery still fondly remembered by many of the people who worked there'

article2title: 'ABOUT THE DISTILLERY'
article2para1: 'Built in 1898 in the midst of a whisky boom and just before the infamous Pattison crash of the same year, Caperdonich has had a very chequered past. Orginally known as Glen Grant no.2 it was planned to work alongside its more famous next-door neighbour but even though with the same water and barley sources and identical hardware, the distillery produced a different spirit. The first closure came only a few years after opening in 1902 and that saw the distillery close its doors for more than 60 years.'
article2para2: 'Production started again in 1965 under the auspices of Glenlivet Distilleries Ltd who sold it to Seagram in 1977 and finally Pernod Ricard in 2001. Shortly after the distillery was closed again and this time for the final time before being dismantled and demolished in 2011. The site is now part of the ever expanding business of Forsyths(Coppersmiths) who make many of the pot stills you find around the world in the whisky industry today.'
article2para3: 'The legacy of Caperdonich does live on in as much as many pieces of equipment found new homes. One set of stills went to Central Scotland and the new Falkirk Distillery in Camelon, the other going further afield to Belgium and the Owl Distillery. Heating tanks went to Glenallachie and the mill is rumoured to be in Annandale Distillery.'
article2para4: 'Caperdonich was never a big distillery and with being closed so much older casks are extremely rare, at Duncan Taylor Scotch Whisky Ltd we are fortunate to have a few casks from the 1960’s which could very well be some of the oldest stock left in the world today. This bottling is truly from a bygone era.'
