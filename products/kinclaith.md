article2title: 'ABOUT THE DISTILLERY'
article2para1: 'Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city has a significant distilling history that many people are unaware of and up until the past few years Kinclaith was the last single malt distillery to have been operating its boundaries.'
article2para2: 'Located with the Strathclyde Grain Distillery complex on the banks of the River Clyde in the Gorbals region of the city, Kinclaith came into being in 1957 when owner at that time, Seager Evans installed a single pair of pot stills. Sadly, there is very little detail of the specifications of the equipment installed as by 1975 the stills were removed and Kinclaith was no more. Estimated to being producing around 200,000 litres of spirit a year it was small even by the standards of the mid 1970’s. We do know that the water for the distillery came from Loch Katrine to the north of Glasgow which even today supply’s the drinking water for the city.'

article2para3: 'On site there are no physical signs that Kinclaith even existed beyond a large green and golden metallic sign located near one of the column stills and would have been where the pot stills were located, the site is now solely for the production of new make Grain spirit which finds its way into many of Scotland’s great blended whiskies.'

article2para4: 'Many people say that after 45-50 years you will see the final stocks from a closed distillery disappear, At Duncan Taylor Scotch Whisky Ltd we have a few of what may well be the last casks in existence from this legendary distillery, tasting whisky such as this reminds you of the skills and the history that has gone before us, a liquid legacy.'
